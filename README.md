# Data-Analysis-on-Hurricanes-Data
In this project, I did some visualization and exploratory data analysis on the provided data set using Python. 

The data set is not shared as I don't own that data set.
The data set provided for answering some basic questions about the data.

Visualized the data using bar plots and visualized the spread of the data using boxplots.

Python code is shared along with a project report that shares visualizations and answers.
